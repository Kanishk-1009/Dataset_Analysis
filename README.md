📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Dataset
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, test assumptions, and check correlations between different features. The goal is to gain meaningful insights that can assist in data preprocessing and building machine learning models.
