📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the structure, patterns, and key insights hidden within the dataset. The main objective is to clean, analyze, and visualize data to derive meaningful conclusions and support further modeling tasks.

🔍 Key Steps Performed

Data Understanding

Overview of dataset shape, features, datatypes, and basic structure

Identifying numerical vs. categorical attributes

Data Cleaning

Handling missing values and duplicates

Removing outliers wherever necessary

Consistent formatting and type corrections

Univariate Analysis

Summary statistics for numerical columns

Distribution plots (histograms, KDE, boxplots)

Categorical feature frequency analysis (count plots)

Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis

Studying relationships between variables using scatter plots, heatmaps, pairplots, etc.

Correlation analysis to identify strongly related features

Feature Insights

Detecting important variables affecting target outcomes

Understanding trends, patterns, and anomalies

Visualization

Clear and interactive charts for better interpretation

Use of libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn (or Plotly if applicable)

🎯 Outcomes

Improved understanding of dataset characteristics

Identification of features for predictive modeling

Better decision-making for feature engineering

Documentation of insights to guide the next steps in the project
